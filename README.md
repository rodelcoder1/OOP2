# AssumHelper
# Overview
This Library provides a comprehensive framework for testing the fundamental assumptions of linear regression models. It implements automated diagnostic tools to check whether your regression model meets the statistical requirements necessary for valid inference and prediction.

## 📌 Purpose

Linear regression relies on several statistical assumptions (linearity, normality, homoscedasticity, independence, etc.). Many students and early researchers struggle with:

* Knowing **which tests** to apply
* Interpreting **statistical results** correctly
* Presenting **clear diagnostics and plots**

**AssumpHelper** addresses these challenges by offering a structured, reusable workflow that checks regression assumptions and explains the results in a clear and organized way.

---

## ✨ Features

* Automated **linear regression assumption testing**
* Built‑in **statistical tests** with interpretation guides
* **Visualization support** for diagnostics
* Beginner‑friendly design with clear outputs
* Modular structure for easy extension
* Suitable for academic, research, and learning purposes

### Supported Assumption Checks

* **Linearity** (e.g., Ramsey RESET Test)
* **Homoscedasticity** (Breusch–Pagan Test)
* **Normality of Residuals** (Shapiro–Wilk Test)
* **Independence of Errors** (Durbin–Watson Test)
* **Model Summary & Diagnostics**

## ⚙️ Installation

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install assumphelper
```

---

## 🚀 Basic Usage

```python
import pandas as pd
import statsmodels.api as sm
import AssumpHelp

df = pd.DataFrame({
    "y": [10, 12, 13, 15, 16, 18],
    "x1": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
})

X = sm.add_constant(df["x1"])
y = df["y"]
model = sm.OLS(y, X).fit()

fitted, residuals = AssumpHelp.prepare_vars(model, X, y)

# Independence of errors
print(AssumpHelp.interpret_dw(model.durbin_watson))

# Normality of residuals
AssumpHelp.plot_assump(fitted, residuals, "normality")

# Homoscedasticity
AssumpHelp.plot_assump(fitted, residuals, "homoscedasticity")

# Linearity
AssumpHelp.plot_assump(fitted, residuals, "linearity")

```

The output includes statistical test results, interpretations, and diagnostic plots.

## 📊 Outputs

AssumpHelper provides:

* Test statistics and p‑values
* Plain‑language interpretation (Pass / Violation)
* Diagnostic plots (residuals, Q‑Q plots, etc.)
* Structured interpretation guides for reports and presentations

---

## 🎓 Intended Users

* Students learning **linear regression**
* Beginners who want clarity without losing rigor

---

## 🧠 Inspiration

This project is inspired by common regression workflows in:

* Statistics & Econometrics courses
* Python libraries such as `statsmodels` and `scikit‑learn`
* The need for **simpler interpretation** of assumption tests

---

## 🔧 Requirements

* Python **3.7+**
* numpy
* pandas
* scipy
* statsmodels
* matplotlib
* seaborn

(See `requirements.txt` for the full list.)
