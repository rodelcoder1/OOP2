Independence Plot (Residuals vs. Order Plot)

If the points are randomly scattered with no pattern, the residuals are independent.
> The assumption of independence is NOT VIOLATED.

If the points show a visible pattern (trend, wave, cycle, or clustering), the residuals are not independent.
> The assumption of independence is VIOLATED.

Always double check with the Durbin–Watson test.
